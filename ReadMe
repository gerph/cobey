CObey 0.01
==========

This is the Obey 0.40 module rewritten in C.

To give it a good exercising, restart to the supervisor prompt (e.g. *Configure NoBoot) and do

*RMKill Obey
*RMLoad $.path.to.CObey
*!Boot

Remember that if you have both Obey and CObey loaded you can control which one the command goes to by 

*CObey:Obey

or 

*Obey:Obey

However, if your Obeyfile itself contains *Obey somewhere, then that will get sent to whichever module gets priority. This may mess things up.
