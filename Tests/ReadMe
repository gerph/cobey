ReadMe for Tests
======

Before running a script, use SetTestCObey to test CObey or use SetTestObey to test Obey.

CacheTest - doesn't work. I need to find an alternative method.
NestTest - sees how many levels of nesting the module can do.
NestTestM - the same, but using the -m option
NestTestT - the same, but doing a tail call to a BASIC program

NestTests will always crash if you have Test$Limit high enough. It keeps going until the SVC stack overflows. Use SetTestCObey and SetTestObey to compare how far the two modules get.
